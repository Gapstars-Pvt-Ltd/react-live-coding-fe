# Fronend React Assessment

Welcome to the technical test for the Fullstack Engineer position. This assignment is designed to assess your skills in frontend development.

This technical test comprises two sections: a basic [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) API implementation and a [React.js](https://react.dev/)-based frontend implementation.

### Backend API

- [ ] Use thid API endpoint [API endpoint](https://fs-industry-card.onrender.com/api/companies)
- [ ] OR use data.json with json server to mock an API endpoint [JSON server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

### Frontend Implementation

- [ ] Fetch the companies' data from the API.
- [ ] The card's title should be the industry name.
- [ ] Display the count of companies in that industry at the top right corner of the card.
- [ ] Implement the company grouping logic by industry on the frontend. Ensure that your implementation is optimized for scalability, particularly in handling large datasets.
- [ ] Use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to implement the card design. Refer to the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/9GvGhDV1Te6bQzS1GLoj8J/Dealroom-FE-Assessment?node-id=0%3A1&t=I6Ph4vb2EAvbkQQ7-1) for design specifications.
